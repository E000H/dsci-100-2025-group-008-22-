    "(1) Data Description:\n",
    "For this project, we will utilize two data frames: players.csv and sessions.csv. The players.csv file contains 7 variables and 196 observations, providing descriptive characteristics for each player who has signed up for the project. I anticipate a few challanges with the current data. The 'Age' variables contain numerous NA values, which could lead to errors during our data analysis. Also, If only a small fraction of players were on for long periods of time(only a few generated a lot of data), then your response will be imbalanced. That affects model choice and evaluation later (accuracy won’t be enough).\n",

A challenge I foresee is that the start_time and end_time variables include both date and time within the same cell, which will complicate data manipulation and reordering.\n",

    "(2) Question: Can we predict a player's experience level based on the number of sessions and the average session length?\n",
    "\n",
    "The response variable of interest is experience, while the explanatory variables include the number of sessions and the average session length. I will analyze the session data to determine how many times each player has logged in and calculate the average length of each session using the start and end times along with the mean() function. Subsequently, I will employ a classification method to predict players' experience levels based on these two quantitative characteristics."
